Compound Interest Calculator-Owen Hunger

This program is a simple compound interest calculator taking four inputs (initial deposit, interest rate in percent, compounds per year, and how many years invested) and outputs the final amount. Three of the inputs are text inputs and one is a dropdown with three options.

The program uses the values inputted in a formula in the js file to calculate the total value. I added a background gradient in the css file as long as a google font, inset borders and shadows. I also added two little gifs and a footer set permanently to the bottom of the page with a repo link. I used padding and margins to make everything lined up with the corners, and utilized sizing to make everything work, like making sure the gradient doesnt repeat itself. I also translated some elements down to create spacing for the transformation element. I added some simple borders to the input sections. I set up a vertical flexbox layout in the body so that everything was spaced well, but had to recenter some stuff after adding that.

Lastly for a bit of fun and to meet the transition requirement, when your cursor passes by the gifs they do a spin!

Some random thing I found is that the compound per year input works exactly as intended. However when you change the compound, the amount output doesnt update unless you change one of the other input boxes. So you could really just re-enter one input to show the updated amout box.
